## Introduction to Web Accessibility

Web accessibility means designing and developing websites that can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities. Accessibility is not just a nice-to-have featureâ€”it's a fundamental aspect of web development that ensures equal access to information and functionality for all users.

<Note>
  According to the World Health Organization, over 1 billion people (about 15%
  of the world's population) live with some form of disability. Creating
  accessible websites ensures that these users can access and interact with your
  docs.
</Note>

## Web docs Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

The Web docs Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are the internationally recognized standards for web accessibility. WCAG is organized around four principles, often referred to as POUR:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Perceivable">
    Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in
    ways they can perceive. This means providing text alternatives for non-text
    docs and creating docs that can be presented in different ways.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Operable">
    User interface components and navigation must be operable. This means making
    all functionality available from a keyboard and giving users enough time to
    read and use docs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Understandable">
    Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.
    This means making text readable and predictable, and helping users avoid and
    correct mistakes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Robust">
    docs must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety
    of user agents, including assistive technologies. This means maximizing
    compatibility with current and future tools.
  </Step>
</Steps>

WCAG has three levels of conformance: A (minimum), AA (recommended), and AAA (enhanced). Most organizations aim for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as a baseline.

## Semantic HTML and Accessibility

Semantic HTML is the foundation of web accessibility. Using the right HTML elements for their intended purpose provides built-in accessibility benefits.

### Document Structure

A proper document structure helps assistive technologies navigate and understand your docs:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" docs="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Accessible Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Website Title</h1>
      <nav>
        <!-- Navigation docs -->
      </nav>
    </header>

    <main>
      <article>
        <h2>Article Title</h2>
        <p>Article docs...</p>
      </article>

      <aside>
        <h2>Related Information</h2>
        <!-- Aside docs -->
      </aside>
    </main>

    <footer>
      <p>Copyright information</p>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

<Tip>
  Using semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` creates landmarks that help screen reader users navigate your page more efficiently.
</Tip>

### Headings

Headings create a hierarchical structure that helps users understand the organization of your docs:

```html
<h1>Main Page Title</h1>

<section>
  <h2>Section Title</h2>
  <p>Section docs...</p>

  <h3>Subsection Title</h3>
  <p>Subsection docs...</p>
</section>
```

<Warning>
  Always maintain a proper heading hierarchy. Don't skip levels (like going from `<h1>` to `<h3>`), and don't use headings just for styling purposes. Screen reader users often navigate by headings, so a proper hierarchy is crucial.
</Warning>

## Text Alternatives for Non-Text docs

### Images

All images should have appropriate alternative text that conveys the purpose or docs of the image:

```html
<!-- Informative image -->
<img src="chart.png" alt="Bar chart showing sales growth from 2020 to 2023" />

<!-- Decorative image -->
<img src="decorative-line.png" alt="" />

<!-- Image with adjacent text description -->
<figure>
  <img src="complex-diagram.png" alt="" />
  <figcaption>
    Diagram showing the water cycle process: evaporation, condensation,
    precipitation, and collection.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
```

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Informative Images" icon="image">
    Should have alt text that conveys the same information as the image
  </Card>
  <Card title="Decorative Images" icon="image">
    Should have empty alt text (`alt=""`) so screen readers skip them
  </Card>
  <Card title="Complex Images" icon="image">
    May need a longer description in addition to alt text
  </Card>
  <Card title="Functional Images" icon="image">
    Should have alt text that describes the function (e.g., "Search" for a
    search icon button)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### SVG

SVG images should also be made accessible:

```html
<svg role="img" aria-labelledby="chart-title chart-desc">
  <title id="chart-title">Quarterly Sales 2023</title>
  <desc id="chart-desc">
    Bar chart showing sales increasing each quarter, with Q4 being the highest
    at $1.2M
  </desc>
  <!-- SVG docs -->
</svg>
```

### Audio and Video

Multimedia docs needs alternatives:

```html
<!-- Audio with transcript -->
<audio controls>
  <source src="podcast.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<a href="podcast-transcript.html">Read the transcript</a>

<!-- Video with captions and audio description -->
<video controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <track
    kind="captions"
    src="captions.vtt"
    srclang="en"
    label="English"
    default
  />
  <track
    kind="descriptions"
    src="descriptions.vtt"
    srclang="en"
    label="English"
  />
  Your browser does not support the video element.
</video>
```

## Keyboard Accessibility

Many users navigate websites using only a keyboard. All interactive elements should be keyboard accessible:

### Focus Management

```html
<!-- Ensure all interactive elements are focusable -->
<button>Click Me</button>

<!-- Don't use divs for buttons unless you add proper ARIA and keyboard support -->
<div
  role="button"
  tabindex="0"
  onclick="handleClick()"
  onkeydown="handleKeydown(event)"
>
  Bad Practice Button
</div>

<!-- Better: use the native button element -->
<button onclick="handleClick()">Good Practice Button</button>
```

### Skip Links

Skip links allow keyboard users to bypass repetitive navigation:

```html
<body>
  <a href="#main-docs" class="skip-link">Skip to main docs</a>

  <header>
    <!-- Header docs -->
  </header>

  <main id="main-docs">
    <!-- Main docs -->
  </main>
</body>
```

With CSS to style the skip link:

```css
.skip-link {
  position: absolute;
  top: -40px;
  left: 0;
  padding: 8px;
  background-color: #fff;
  z-index: 100;
}

.skip-link:focus {
  top: 0;
}
```

## Forms

Forms are often challenging for users with disabilities. Here's how to make them more accessible:

### Labels

Every form control should have a label:

```html
<!-- Using the for attribute to associate the label with the input -->
<label for="name">Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="name" name="name" />

<!-- Wrapping the input with the label -->
<label>
  Email:
  <input type="email" name="email" />
</label>
```

### Fieldsets and Legends

Group related form controls with fieldset and legend:

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Shipping Address</legend>

  <div>
    <label for="street">Street:</label>
    <input type="text" id="street" name="street" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <label for="city">City:</label>
    <input type="text" id="city" name="city" />
  </div>
</fieldset>
```

### Error Messages

Provide clear error messages and associate them with the relevant form controls:

```html
<label for="password">Password:</label>
<input
  type="password"
  id="password"
  name="password"
  aria-describedby="password-error"
/>
<p id="password-error" class="error">
  Password must be at least 8 characters long.
</p>
```

### Required Fields

Clearly indicate required fields:

```html
<label for="username">Username: <span class="required">*</span></label>
<input
  type="text"
  id="username"
  name="username"
  required
  aria-required="true"
/>
```

## ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)

ARIA attributes can enhance accessibility when HTML alone isn't sufficient:

### ARIA Roles

```html
<div role="alert">Your form has been submitted successfully!</div>

<div role="tablist">
  <button role="tab" aria-selected="true" aria-controls="panel1">Tab 1</button>
  <button role="tab" aria-selected="false" aria-controls="panel2">Tab 2</button>
</div>

<div id="panel1" role="tabpanel">docs for Tab 1</div>
<div id="panel2" role="tabpanel" hidden>docs for Tab 2</div>
```

### ARIA States and Properties

```html
<!-- Indicate the current state of a toggle button -->
<button aria-pressed="false">Toggle Feature</button>

<!-- Provide additional description for a form field -->
<label for="password">Password:</label>
<input type="password" id="password" aria-describedby="password-help" />
<p id="password-help">
  Password must include at least 8 characters with a number and a special
  character.
</p>

<!-- Indicate that an element is expanded or collapsed -->
<button aria-expanded="false">Show Details</button>
<div hidden>Additional details here...</div>
```

<Warning>
  The first rule of ARIA is: "If you can use a native HTML element or attribute
  with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of
  re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it
  accessible, then do so." Only use ARIA when necessary.
</Warning>

## Color and Contrast

Color should not be the only means of conveying information, and text should have sufficient contrast against its background:

```html
<!-- Bad: using only color to indicate required fields -->
<label style="color: red;">Name:</label>
<input type="text" required />

<!-- Good: using both color and an asterisk symbol -->
<label style="color: red;">Name: <span aria-label="required">*</span></label>
<input type="text" required aria-required="true" />

<!-- Good: using an icon with proper text alternative -->
<label>
  Name:
  <svg aria-label="required" role="img" width="10" height="10">
    <!-- SVG docs for a star icon -->
  </svg>
</label>
<input type="text" required aria-required="true" />
```

<Tip>
  WCAG 2.1 AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and
  3:1 for large text. You can use tools like the WebAIM Contrast Checker to
  verify your color combinations.
</Tip>

## Tables

Tables should be used for tabular data only and need proper structure for accessibility:

```html
<table>
  <caption>
    Monthly Sales by Region
  </caption>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Region</th>
      <th scope="col">January</th>
      <th scope="col">February</th>
      <th scope="col">March</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">North</th>
      <td>$10,000</td>
      <td>$12,000</td>
      <td>$15,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">South</th>
      <td>$8,000</td>
      <td>$9,000</td>
      <td>$10,000</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="caption" icon="caption">
    Provides a title or description for the table
  </Card>
  <Card title="th" icon="table-cells">
    Defines header cells with scope attribute indicating row or column headers
  </Card>
  <Card title="thead, tbody, tfoot" icon="table-list">
    Group header, body, and footer rows
  </Card>
  <Card title="scope" icon="arrows-to-dot">
    Indicates whether a header cell is for a row or column
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Dynamic docs and AJAX

When docs changes dynamically, users with assistive technology need to be informed:

```html
<!-- Alert users of important updates -->
<div role="alert" id="notification"></div>

<script>
  function showNotification(message) {
    const notification = document.getElementById('notification');
    notification.textdocs = message;
    // The role="alert" will cause screen readers to announce this message
  }

  // Later, when something happens:
  showNotification('Your form has been submitted successfully!');
</script>

<!-- For less urgent updates -->
<div aria-live="polite" id="status">Loading results...</div>

<script>
  // When results are loaded:
  document.getElementById('status').textdocs = '10 results found';
  // Screen readers will announce this when they're not busy with other docs
</script>
```

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title='aria-live="assertive"' icon="bullhorn">
    For important updates that should interrupt the user
  </Card>
  <Card title='aria-live="polite"' icon="volume-low">
    For updates that shouldn't interrupt the user
  </Card>
  <Card title='role="alert""' icon="bell">
    Equivalent to aria-live="assertive" with aria-atomic="true"
  </Card>
  <Card title='role="status""' icon="circle-info">
    Equivalent to aria-live="polite" with aria-atomic="true"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Testing for Accessibility

Accessibility testing should be part of your development process:

### Automated Testing

Use tools like:

- [axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/)
- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/)
- [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)

### Manual Testing

1. **Keyboard testing**: Navigate your site using only the keyboard
2. **Screen reader testing**: Test with screen readers like NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver
3. **Zoom testing**: Test your site at 200% zoom
4. **Color contrast checking**: Verify text contrast meets WCAG requirements
