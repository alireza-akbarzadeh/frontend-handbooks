# HTML Accessibility

Web accessibility means designing and developing websites that can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities. Accessibility is not just a nice-to-have featureâ€”it's a fundamental aspect of web development that ensures equal access to information and functionality for all users.

## Key Principles of Accessibility

### 1. Perceivable

Users must be able to perceive the information being presented.

- Provide text alternatives for non-text content
- Create content that can be presented in different ways

### 2. Operable

Users must be able to operate the interface.

- Make all functionality available from a keyboard
- Give users enough time to read and use content

### 3. Understandable

Users must be able to understand the information and UI operation.

- Make text readable and understandable
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes

### 4. Robust

Content must work reliably across various user agents and assistive technologies.

- Maximize compatibility with current and future tools

## Steps to Make a Website Accessible

<Steps>
    <Step title="Use Semantic HTML">
        Use proper HTML elements for their intended purpose (e.g., `button` for actions).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Ensure Keyboard Navigation">
        All interactive elements should be keyboard accessible.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add ARIA When Needed">
        Use ARIA only when native HTML semantics aren't sufficient.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Provide Text Alternatives">
        Include alt text for images and proper form labels.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Use Color Carefully">
        Ensure good contrast and don't rely solely on color.
    </Step>
</Steps>
