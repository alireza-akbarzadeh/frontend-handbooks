# Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML means using HTML elements that clearly describe their meaning to both the browser and the developer.

## Why Semantics Matter

Semantic HTML is important for:

- **Accessibility**: Screen readers and assistive technologies use semantics to help users navigate docs
- **SEO**: Search engines better understand your docs
- **Maintainability**: Code is easier to read and maintain
- **Mobile optimization**: Helps with responsive design
